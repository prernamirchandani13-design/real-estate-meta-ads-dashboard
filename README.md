# real-estate-meta-ads-dashboard
Marketing analytics project focused on evaluating Meta Ads campaign performance using pivot tables, calculated metrics, and dashboards in MS-Excel

Project Overview
This project analyzes Meta (Facebook and Instagram) advertising performance data for a real estate business using Google Sheets. The objective is to evaluate campaign efficiency, lead generation performance, and appointment conversions to derive actionable insights for budget optimization and growth.
The analysis focuses on understanding how different campaigns, cities, and lead types (Buyer vs Seller) perform across the marketing funnel.

Business Objective
Evaluate ad performance across campaigns and locations
Identify cost efficiency using key performance metrics
Compare Buyer vs Seller lead behavior
Recommend areas for optimization and budget reallocation

Tools Used
MS Execel
Pivot Tables
Data Cleaning and Calculated Metrics
Data Visualization (Charts and Dashboard)

Dataset
Source: Internal Meta Ads performance dataset (Real Estate)
Data includes:
Date
Campaign Name
Ad Set
City
Lead Type (Buyer / Seller)
Spend
Impressions
Clicks
Leads
Appointments Booked

Metrics Calculated
The following calculated fields were created at the data level:
CTR (Click Through Rate) = Clicks / Impressions
CPC (Cost per Click) = Spend / Clicks
CPL (Cost per Lead) = Spend / Leads
Cost per Appointment = Spend / Appointments Booked
These metrics were used consistently across pivot analysis and dashboards.

Analysis Performed
Pivot Analysis
Campaign-wise spend, leads, and appointments
City-wise performance and cost efficiency
Buyer vs Seller lead comparison
Funnel analysis from clicks to appointments

Dashboard
A summary dashboard was created to visualize:
Total Spend
Total Leads
Average CPL
Total Appointments
Leads by Campaign
CPL by City
Buyer vs Seller Lead Distribution
Spend Trends Over Time

Key Insights
Certain campaigns delivered significantly lower CPL but weaker appointment conversion
Seller leads were generally more cost-efficient than Buyer leads
Performance varied strongly by city, indicating scope for geographic budget optimization
Some campaigns generated high leads but low appointment bookings, highlighting funnel drop-offs

Recommendations
Reallocate budget toward campaigns with stronger appointment conversion
Optimize Buyer-focused campaigns to improve cost efficiency
Reduce spend in underperforming cities and test new targeting strategies
Focus optimization beyond CPL and include downstream conversion metrics

Outcome
